# Bike-Sharing-Demand-Prediction-  


   This is a machine learning project which helps to predict the sales and outcomes of the bikes to be leased out on a paticular day. This gives a basic idea on how much sales to be made on a given day at an instant. For completing the project I used many of the tools in machine learning like  -  matplotlib                                                                                                                                                                                                           -  numpy                                                                                                                                                                                                                -  seaborn                                                                                                                                                                                                              -  linear regression                                                                                                                                                                                                    -   random forest 
      This gives a brief note about the way i made the project and achived the approximate prediction value of the lease of the bikes and its effects on the next upcoming purchases.
